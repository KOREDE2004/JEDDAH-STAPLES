	<h3>A former governor of Ekiti State, Mr Ayodele Fayose, has said Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde,  
	is not the leader of the Peoples Democratic Party in the South-west.

    He noted that leadership should be earned and not for anyone as a title.

    Fayose added that an ex-Ondo State Information Commissioner, Dr Eddy Olafeso, should be the next
    PDP National Vice Chairman (West) as, accosrding to him, earlier agreed in Makinde’s house at
    Ibadan, Oyo State.

    Fayose and Makinde have been at loggerheads over the leadership of the South-West PDP.

    The ex-governor spoke in Lagos on Monday while receiving prominent members of the party who paid 
    him a solidarity visit.

    The delegation was led by Senator Nicholas Tofowomo, representing Ondo South District in the
    National Assembly.

    Among the delegation were Olafeso, former House of Representatives member, Lad Ojomo, ex-House 
    of Assembly member, Niyi Ogunboye, Chief Ibini Oyedele, Chief Tunde Akindehin, Pastor Larry Ogunmusere,
    Ife Akinsoyinu, Sola Ebiwonjumi, Olusola Adewo, Adeolu Akinseye and Ebenezer Alabi.

    Fayose commended members of the delegation for “not sitting on the fence.”

    He stated, “It is dangerous to sit on the fence. I don’t play to the gallery.”

    He also berated Makinde’s supporters for calling him an “APC man,” adding that why wasn’t he labelled 
    as such when he supported the Oyo State governor and worked for his victory in last general election
